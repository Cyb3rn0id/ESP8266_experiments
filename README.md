# R4WebRemote
Control of 4 relays via Wi-Fi Network with ESP8266 and Android.
I've used a Linksprite LinkNode R4 that has 4 relay attached to digital I/Os 12,13,14 and 16
ESP8266 is programmed using Arduino IDE.

Android APP is not necessary since ESP8266 generates a webpage that can be viewed with every browser, but having an APP is more cool and the interface is more beautiful!
